A Neural Network In Scala
=========================

**First** This project is about learning. I aim to learn two things
from this project.

* scala
* neural networks

The idea is based on i am trask's blogpost,
[A Neural network in 11 rows of python](https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/).
But then  i knew python, and not scala.
